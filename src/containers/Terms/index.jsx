	                    <li>Indemnification. You agree to defend, indemnify, save, and hold the Redulo Parties harmless from any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, including legal fees and expenses, arising out

	                        by you herein. Redulo reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify Redulo and you agree to cooperate
	                        with Redulo's defense of these claims. Redulo will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action or proceeding upon becoming aware of it. You agree that the provisions in this

	                Dispute Resolution.
	                <ol>
	                    <li>General. If a dispute arises between you and Redulo, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Accordingly, you and Redulo agree
	                        that we will resolve any claim or controversy at law or equity that arises out of this Agreement or our services (a <strong>"Claim"</strong>) in accordance with one of the subsections below or as we and you
	                        otherwise agree in writing. Before resorting to these alternatives, we strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution by going to Customer Support. We will consider
	                        reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution procedures, such as mediation or arbitration, as alternatives to litigation. Other than those matters listed
	                        in Section 8.2, you and Redulo agree to seek resolution of the dispute only through arbitration of that dispute in accordance with the terms of this Section 8, and not litigate any dispute in
	                    court. Arbitration means that the dispute will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury.</li>
	                    <li>Exclusions from Arbitration. YOU AND REDULO AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM FILED BY YOU OR BY REDULO IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT OR BY REDULO RELATED TO PROTECTION OF REDULO'S OR
	                    ANY REDULO LICENSOR'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 8. </li>
	                    <li>RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER WITHIN 30 DAYS. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN THIS SECTION
	                    8, YOU MUST NOTIFY REDULO IN WRITING WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT. YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION MUST BE MAILED TO REDULO TERMS ADMINISTRATOR, AND MUST INCLUDE: (1) YOUR NAME, (2) YOUR ADDRESS, (3) YOUR USERNAME, AND (4) A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH REDULO THROUGH ARBITRATION.</li>
	                    <li>Class Action Waiver. ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A NAMED OR UNNAMED MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND REDULO SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO DO SO IN WRITING FOLLOWING INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATION.</li>
	                    <li>Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding; Selection of Arbitrator. If you or Redulo elect to resolve your dispute through arbitration, the party initiating the arbitration proceeding must
	                    initiate it with the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). The terms of this Section 8 will govern in the event they conflict with the arbitration rules identified below.</li>
	                    <li>Arbitration Procedures. Because the software and/or service provided to you by Redulo concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") governs the arbitrability of all
	                        disputes. However, applicable federal or state law may also apply to the substance of any disputes. For claims of less than $75,000, the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules shall apply; for
	                        claims over $75,000, the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules and relevant fee schedules for non-class action proceedings shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling
	                        1-800-778-7879. Further, if your claims do not exceed $75,000 and you provided notice to, and negotiated in good faith with, Redulo as described above, and if the arbitrator finds that you
	                        are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator, in addition to any rights to recover the same
	                        under controlling state or federal law afforded to Redulo or you. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such
	                    award will be binding and final, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</li>
	                    <li>Location of Arbitration. You or Redulo may initiate arbitration in either Orange County, California or the county in which you reside. If you initiate arbitration
	                        in the county of your residence, Redulo may transfer the arbitration to Orange County, California <em>provided</em> that Redulo agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a
	                        result of the change in location, as determined by the arbitrator.
	                    </li>
	                    <li>Severability. If any clause within this Section 8 (other than the Class Action Waiver clause of Section 8.4) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause
	                        will be severed from this Section 8 and the remainder of this Section 8 will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver (Section 8.4) clause is found to be illegal or
	                        unenforceable, this entire Section 8, except for this Section 8.8, will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court and IN THAT INSTANCE, YOU AND REDULO EACH WAIVE AND AGREE
	                        TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY, TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW.
	                    </li>
	                    <li>Survival. This Section 8 shall survive any termination of the Terms.</li>

	                            <li>Right to Update. Redulo reserves the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of these Terms and our Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended Terms
		                        or Privacy Policy through the Service. You may also be given additional notice, such as an email message or messaging within the Service, of any changes. You will be deemed to have
		                        accepted such changes by continuing to use the Service. Except as otherwise stated, all amended terms shall automatically be effective thirty (30) calendar days after they are initially
		                        posted. Redulo may also revise other policies, codes or rules at any time and the new versions will be available on www.Redulo.com or in the Service. No amendment to the Terms or Privacy
		                    Policy shall apply to any dispute of which Redulo had actual notice before the date of the amendment.</li>
	                            <li>Seeking Consent. If Redulo revises these Terms or its Privacy Policy and seeks your consent to be bound by such revised Terms or revised Privacy Policy and you do not agree to be
		                        bound by such revised Terms or revised Privacy Policy before using the Service again, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Redulo reserves the right to terminate your Account
		                    and use of the Service.</li>
	                            <li>Disagreement With Terms. If at any time you do not agree to any provision of the then-current version of our Terms, the Privacy Policy or any other Redulo policy, rule or code of
		                    conduct relating to your use of the Service, your right to use the Service will immediately terminate, and you must immediately stop using the Service.</li>
	                            <li>Conflict. To the extent these Terms or the Privacy Policy conflict with any other Redulo terms, policy, rule, or code of conduct, the provisions of these Terms and the Privacy Policy
		                    will prevail.</li>
	                        </ol>
	                    </li>
	                    <li>Severability. If any provision of these Terms or the Privacy Policy is found invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, in whole or in part, by any court of competent
	                        jurisdiction, such provision will, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective solely to the extent of such determination of invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability without affecting the
	                        validity, legality, or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of the Terms, which will continue to be in full force and
	                        effect.
	                    </li>
	                    <li>
	                        Assignment. Redulo may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time
	                        without your consent. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under the Terms without the prior written consent of Redulo; any purported assignment or delegation in
	                        violation of this Section> 9.3 is void.
	                    </li>
	                    <li>
	                        Supplemental Policies. Redulo may publish additional policies related to specific services such as forums, contests, or loyalty programs. Your use, if any, of such
	                        services is subject to such specific policies and these Terms.
	                    </li>
	                    <li>Entire Agreement. These Terms, together with any supplemental policies, the Privacy Policy, and any other documents expressly incorporated by reference herein, contain the entire
	                        agreement between Redulo and you with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties of the
	                    parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof, whether electronic, oral or written, or whether established by custom, practice, policy or precedent.</li>
	                    <li>No Waiver. The failure of Redulo to require or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of these Terms or the Privacy Policy or failure to exercise any right under them shall
	                        not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of Redulo's right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance. The express waiver by Redulo of any
	                        provision, condition or requirement of these Terms or the Privacy Policy shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement. Except
	                        as expressly and specifically set forth in these Terms, no representations, statements, consents, waivers or other acts or omissions by Redulo shall be deemed a modification of these Terms
	                    nor legally binding, unless documented in physical writing, hand signed by you and a duly appointed officer of Redulo.</li>

	                        without compliance with this  9.7 shall have no legal effect.

	                    <li>Equitable Remedies. You acknowledge that the rights granted and obligations made under these Terms to Redulo are of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which shall irreparably
	                        harm Redulo and which cannot be replaced by monetary damages alone, so that Redulo shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligations of posting any bond or
	                        surety or proof of damages) in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you. You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief, or to enjoin or restrain
	                        the operation of the Service, exploitation of any advertising or other materials issued in connection therewith, or exploitation of the Service or any content or other material used or
	                    displayed through the Service and agree to limit your claims to claims for monetary damages, limited by Section 7.2.</li>
	                    <li>Force Majeure. Redulo shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside the reasonable control of Redulo, including without limitation any failure to
	                        perform hereunder due to unforeseen circumstances or cause beyond Redulo's control, such as acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods,
	                    accidents, strikes, shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.</li>
